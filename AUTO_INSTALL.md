# Quick Installation Guide

## What Just Happened

I've attempted to open an Administrator PowerShell window to install Node.js. 

## Next Steps:

### If the installation window appeared:
1. **Approve the installation** if prompted
2. **Wait for installation to complete**
3. **Close that PowerShell window**
4. **Come back here** and I'll help you install the project dependencies

### If nothing happened or you prefer manual installation:

**Manual Method (Easiest):**

1. **Download Node.js:**
   - Open your browser
   - Go to: https://nodejs.org/
   - Click the big green "Download Node.js (LTS)" button
   - Save the .msi file

2. **Install:**
   - Double-click the downloaded file
   - Click "Next" through all steps
   - Make sure "Add to PATH" is checked
   - Click "Install"
   - Wait for completion

3. **Restart PowerShell:**
   - Close this PowerShell window
   - Open a new one
   - Navigate back: `cd C:\Users\karti\Website_Work`

4. **Tell me when done** and I'll run:
   ```powershell
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## After Node.js is Installed

Once Node.js is installed, I can automatically:
- ✅ Install all project dependencies (`npm install`)
- ✅ Start the development server (`npm run dev`)
- ✅ Open the website in your browser

Just let me know when Node.js installation is complete!
